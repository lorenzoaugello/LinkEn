Given the adjective “{adjective}”, generate its corresponding deadjectival adverb, if it exists, like in the following example: “slowly” is
the deadjectival adverb of the adjective “slow”. Only one deadjectival adverb must be generated. Do not re-generate the input adjective.
There are adjectives that do not have a related deadjectival adverb, so if the adjective “{adjective}” does not have a deadjectival adverb,
do not output anything.
